The aim of this tutorial is to briefly describe how to compile Kratos with ThreadSanitizer (or TSan) and run a test example from a python script. If someone is interested in the details of ThreadSanitizer and data race bugs, please read the manual https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerCppManual.

Let us notice that ThreadSanitizer is supported on Linux x86_64 and is part of clang 3.2 and gcc 4.8. This tutorial has been tested in Ubuntu 16.04 with gcc 6.3.0, compiling Kratos in release mode.

First, modify the CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS in your configure.sh with '''-fsanitize=thread''' and '''-ltsan''' flags:

 -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -msse3 -std=c++11 -fsanitize=thread -ltsan"     \

Once the compilation finishes, test examples must be run by '''pre-loading the ThreadSanitizer library''' of your compiler. For instance, in our case it was:

 LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/gcc-6.3.0/lib64/libtsan.so python3 MainKratos.py
